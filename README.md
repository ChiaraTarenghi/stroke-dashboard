## üìä Dataset
Dataset: **Stroke Prediction Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
- 5,110 patient records
- Features: demographic, lifestyle, and health risk factors
- Target: `stroke` (1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Due to file size/licensing, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.  
To run the dashboard locally, download the CSV from Kaggle and place it in:
